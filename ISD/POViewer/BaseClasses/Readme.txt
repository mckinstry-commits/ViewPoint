Source code for all of the Base Classes is available in your installation directory:

	<installation directory>\BaseClasses

The base classes provide certain application functionality to your applications.  The base classes include utility classes and functions, and some data access layer base classes.  These classes are the basic building blocks that are critical to secure, reliable systems, but can be cumbersome to build.

The purpose of the base classes is two-fold.  First, the base classes provide extensions to the Microsoft .NET Framework to deliver additional functionality.  Second, it enables you to add features that apply to the entire application by making changes to these classes.

Each application created with includes to compiled base class assemblies in the \bin directory: BaseClasses.dll.  

Please consult the Base Classes section in the online help for more information.
