needs to be preserved).

Launch Excel
Open respective McKARAgingDataset.xltm file (do not double click on the xltm file as it is a template and will lauch a new "instance"
Navigate to the "Data" tab
Click the "Connections" button
For each listed Connection, click the "Properties" button, then the "Definition" tab and verify the connection information.
When complete, save the xltm file.

Note:  
If you test using the actual xltm file , be sure to reset the queries so that the where clause includes "1=0" 
and refresh before saving.  Also reset the default value of the "Snapshot Month" field on the "Overview" tab (cell M2) to be "=EOMONTH(NOW(),-1)+1"
This will allow the workbook to be saved with no data preloaded and the "Snapshot Month" to be defaulted to the first day of the current month.
