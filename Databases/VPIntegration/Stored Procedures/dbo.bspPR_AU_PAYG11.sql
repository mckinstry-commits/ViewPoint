*				KK/EN 7/14/2011 TK-06805 #144283 Fixed amount typos Scale: 2, 51, and 7
*
* USAGE:
* 	Calculates Australia PAYG (Pay As You Go) national income tax
*
*	In general, the tax computation is based on a formula (y = ax â€“ b) laid out in the NAT 1004 document found
*	on the ATO (Australian federal government) website.
*	From this value the Medicare Levy Adjustment is subtracted if applicable (Scales 2, 21, 6, 61, 7 and 71 only).  
*	Also the Tax Offset will be subtracted if applicable (Scales 2, 21, 5, 51, 6, 61, 7 and 71 only).
*
* INPUT PARAMETERS:
*	@subjamt 	subject earnings
*	@ppds		# of pay pds per year
*	@Scale		used to determine coefficients and tax computation methods
*	@status		"M" if employee submitted a Medicare levy variation declaration and claimed a spouse, otherwise "S"
*	@addlexempts	# of children if employee submitted a Medicare levy variation and claimed dependent children
*	@nonresalienyn	"Y" if employee is a nonresident alien, otherwise "N"
*	@ftb_offset	total FTB amount and tax offset claimed by employee on the Withholding declaration
*
* OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
*	@amt		calculated tax amount
*	@msg		error message if failure
*
* RETURN VALUE:
* 	0 	    success
*	1 		failure
