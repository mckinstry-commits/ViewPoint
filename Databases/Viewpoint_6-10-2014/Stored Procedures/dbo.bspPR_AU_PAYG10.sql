   * CREATED BY: 	EN 6/04/08
   * MODIFIED BY:	EN 9/17/08  for payments made on or after 1 July 2008
   *				EN 9/8/09  #134853  update effective as of 1 July 2009
   *				EN 2/2/2010 #137909 (version 092) add ability to compute HELP component
   *				EN 9/8/09  #134853  update effective as of 1 July 2009
   *
   * USAGE:
   * 	Calculates Australia PAYG (Pay As You Go) national income tax
   *
   *	In general, the tax computation is based on a formula (y = ax â€“ b) laid out in the NAT 1004 document found
   *	on the ATO (Australian federal government) website.
   *	From this value the Medicare Levy Adjustment is subtracted if applicable (Scales 2, 21, 6, 61, 7 and 71 only).  
   *	Also the Tax Offset will be subtracted if applicable (Scales 2, 21, 5, 51, 6, 61, 7 and 71 only).
   *
   * INPUT PARAMETERS:
   *	@subjamt 	subject earnings
   *	@ppds		# of pay pds per year
   *	@Scale		used to determine coefficients and tax computation methods
   *	@status		"M" if employee submitted a Medicare levy variation declaration and claimed a spouse, otherwise "S"
   *	@addlexempts	# of children if employee submitted a Medicare levy variation and claimed dependent children
   *	@nonresalienyn	"Y" if employee is a nonresident alien, otherwise "N"
   *	@ftb_offset	total FTB amount and tax offset claimed by employee on the Withholding declaration
   *
   * OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
   *	@amt		calculated tax amount
   *	@msg		error message if failure
   *
   * RETURN VALUE:
   * 	0 	    	success
   *	1 		failure
